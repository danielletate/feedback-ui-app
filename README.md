# React Feedback App
This application was modeled after Brad Traversy's React Front To Back 2022 course project and demonstrates understanding of:
* Components
* JSX
* Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
* State (Component & App Level)
* Styling
* Handling Events
* Lists & Keys
* Forms
* Context API
* HTTP Requests



*This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000*
